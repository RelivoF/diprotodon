	    <p class="w3-justify">
            The Diprotodon is an extinct genus of marsupial from the Pleistocene of Australia containing only one species, D. optatum. The earliest finds of the Diprotodon are dated 1.77 million to 780,000 years ago but most specimens are dated to after 110,000 years ago.
        </p>

        <h3 class="w3-wide">Habitat</h3>

        <p class="w3-justify">
            Diprotodon preferred semi-arid plains, savannahs and open woodlands, and is generally absent from hilly, forested coastal regions (where a smaller diprotodontid, Zygomaturus, is usually found). Diprotodon is known from some coastal localities, as well as Naracoorte Caves and Kangaroo Island in South Australia.
        </p>

        <h3 class="w3-wide">Physical Characteristics</h3>

        <p class="w3-justify">
            Diprotodon, the largest known marsupial, was a herbivorous, quadrupedal animal with thick, sturdy limbs and wombat-like feet, resembling a gigantic wombat or a pouched rhinoceros.
        
            They used their strong incisors and bilophodont teeth to eat vegetation like twigs, leaves, and grass, and may have used their incisors to fight for mates or fend off predators. 

        </p>

        <h3 class="w3-wide">Diet</h3>

        <p class="w3-justify">
            Diprotodon may have eaten as much as 100 to 150 kilograms of vegetation daily. Its chisel-like incisors may have been used to pull out vegetation.
        </p>

        <h3 class="w3-wide">Behaviour</h3>

        <p class="w3-justify">
            Diprotodons were likely herbivorous megafauna, with some evidence suggesting they moved seasonally, possibly in smaller family groups, though the exact nature of their social behavior is still debated. They are thought to have had a polygynous mating system and were adapted to a diet of plants, including saltbush.
        </p>

        <h3 class="w3-wide">Life Cycle</h3>

        <p class="w3-justify">
            The Diprotodon lives for up to 50 years. The female Diprotodon could have given birth 5 times in their life.
