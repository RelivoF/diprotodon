            The Diprotodon is an extinct genus of marsupial from the Pleistocene of Australia containing only one species, D. optatum. The earliest finds of the Diprotodon are dated 1.77 million to 780,000 years ago but most specimens are dated to after 110,000 years ago. Its remains were first discovered in 1830 in Wellington Caves, New South Wales, and contemporaneous paleontologists believed they belonged to rhinos, elephants, hippos or dugongs. Diprotodon was formally described by English naturalist Richard Owen in 1838, and was the first named Australian fossil mammal, and led Owen to become the foremost authority of his time on other marsupials and Australian megafauna, which were enigmatic to European science.
